# TheDojo

Inside `TheDojo` repo there are files for finding friends, works well.
Insde 'WordsAndNumbers` there is a `Demo` repo that contains `js` files that should be working. And required files for the test.
The `WordsAndNumbers` has sorted data but I do not think that I answered the quesstions accordingly. Will later on fix this.
